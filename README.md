# VSBreakpointExtension

This extension allows them to set breakpoints at the touch of a button. For example, for all methods or all properties in the current class.

It also allows you to deactivate all breakpoints in the current document/project or the entire solution, to delete them or to remove only the deactivated ones.

This extension has been a quick solution for me and will be developed further.

To use the extension, you can install it in the Visual Studio [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=timi992000.BreakpointManager).

To set breakpoints etc. a new menu item is available under "Tools" which provides a new toolwindow.
